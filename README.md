## 1 Purpose of this repo
The purpose of this repo is mainly to explore [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/). Tests can be found in [tests](tests). 

To ensure code quality, this repository leverages the capabilities of pre-commit. If you're curious about pre-commit and want to explore its capabilities further, I recommend checking out this other repository: https://github.com/anneglienke/101_pre-commit

## 2 Running locally
To run locally, you will need Python 3.11 or newer installed in your local environment. Then, just install the dependencies and execute the `main.py` file:

Create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate local environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install git hooks (optional, do it only if you wanna use pre-commit):
```
pre-commit install
```

Run script:
```
python3 src/main.py
```

Run tests:
```
pytest -v tests
```
Run test coverage command to generate report locally (it will be generated by the GitHub Actions pipeline automatically and it will be stored as an artifact. You can look for it there instead of generating it locally, if you prefer.):
```
pytest --cov --cov-report=html
```

If you installed git hooks but wanna skip pre-commit checks, run:
```
git commit -m"message" --no-verify
```
